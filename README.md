# todoApp-react-native-redux
A todoApp created in react-native using redux architecture.

## Motivation

I needed learn redux to apply in my react-native projects. Therefore I was looking for a good tutorial, and I found!!

- [Redux-Tutorial](https://github.com/happypoulp/redux-tutorial)
- [EggHead - Getting Started Redux](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-the-single-immutable-state-tree)

Using these tutorials I created this example project.

## Why use?

You can use it like a base to learn how to implement redux with react-native.

Redux is simple to understand, but the most tutorials are created based using react and not react-native, therefore you have a react-native example.
